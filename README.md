# nsjail-debian

Debian packaging files for [`nsjail`](https://github.com/google/nsjail), a lightweight sandboxing tool based on Linux namespaces, cgroups, rlimits, and seccomp-BPF.

This repository contains only the `debian/` directory required to build `.deb` packages of `nsjail` from upstream source. It is intended for use by maintainers, packagers, and advanced users who want to create and install `nsjail` via the Debian packaging system.
